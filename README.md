# Laptop Price Prediction using Machine Learning

A machine learning project for predicting laptop prices using regression models, supported by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and standard evaluation metrics.

---

## Objective
The objective of this project is to implement, analyze, and compare various Linear Regression models to predict laptop prices based on multiple hardware and software features.

This assignment helps in understanding:
- Simple Linear Regression  
- Multiple Linear Regression  
- Polynomial Regression  
- Regularization Techniques (Ridge and Lasso)  
along with proper evaluation and interpretation.

- ScreenResolution  
- CPU  
- RAM  
- Memory  
- GPU  
- Operating System  
- Weight  

### Target Variable

---

## Tools and Technologies
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  

### Libraries Used
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn

## Methodology

### Part A: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Loaded the dataset and examined its structure  
- Generated summary statistics for numerical features  
- Checked for missing values and handled unnecessary columns  
- Visualized feature distributions  
- Created a correlation heatmap to analyze relationships between variables  

---

### Part B: Simple Linear Regression
- Selected a single feature (e.g., RAM or Inches)  
- Built a Simple Linear Regression model  
- Plotted the regression line  
- Interpreted slope and intercept values  

---

### Part C: Multiple Linear Regression
- Used multiple features to predict laptop prices  
- Trained a Multiple Linear Regression model  
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
  - R² Score  
- Interpreted regression coefficients  

---

### Part D: Polynomial Regression
- Applied Polynomial Regression to capture non-linear relationships  
- Compared Linear and Polynomial Regression results  
- Observed improved prediction accuracy for non-linear patterns  

---

### Part E: Regularization Techniques
- Applied Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression  
- Compared coefficients with Linear Regression  
- Discussed feature selection and overfitting control  

---

### Part F: Model Diagnostics
- Plotted residuals vs predicted values  
- Checked regression assumptions such as linearity and homoscedasticity  

---

## Results and Observations
- Multiple Linear Regression performed better than Simple Linear Regression  
- Polynomial Regression captured non-linear relationships more effectively  
- Ridge and Lasso Regression helped reduce overfitting  
- RAM, CPU, and Storage were identified as strong predictors of laptop price

## Conclusion
This project provided hands-on experience with different linear regression models and demonstrated how regression techniques can be applied to real-world price prediction problems.

The assignment improved understanding of model selection, evaluation, and interpretation, successfully fulfilling all objectives of the Linear Regression Lab.
